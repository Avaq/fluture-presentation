If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n     * following are equivalent:\n     *\n     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n     *\n     * @func\n     * @memberOf R\n     * @since v0.5.0\n     * @category Function\n     * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n     * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n     * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n     * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n     * @see R.curry\n     * @example\n     *\n     *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n     *\n     *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n     *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n     *      var g = f(3);\n     *      g(4); //=> 10\n     */\n    var curryN = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n        if (length === 1) {\n            return _curry1(fn);\n        }\n        return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n    });\n\n    /**\n     * Decrements its argument.\n     *\n     * @func\n     * @memberOf R\n     * @since v0.9.0\n     * @category Math\n     * @sig Number -> Number\n     * @param {Number} n\n     * @return {Number}\n     * @see R.inc\n     * @example\n     *\n     *      R.dec(42); //=> 41\n     */\n    var dec = add(-1);\n\n    /**\n     * Returns the second argument if it is not `null`, `undefined` or `NaN`\n     * otherwise the first argument is returned.\n     *\n     * @func\n     * @memberOf R\n     * @since v0.10.0\n     * @category Logic\n     * @sig a -> b -> a | b\n     * @param {a} val The default value.\n     * @param {b} val The value to return if it is not null or undefined\n     * @return {*} The the second value or the default value\n     * @example\n     *\n     *      var defaultTo42 = R.defaultTo(42);\n     *\n     *      defaultTo42(null);  //=> 42\n     *      defaultTo42(undefined);  //=> 42\n     *      defaultTo42('Ramda');  //=> 'Ramda'\n     *      defaultTo42(parseInt('string')); //=> 42\n     */\n    var defaultTo = _curry2(function defaultTo(d, v) {\n        return v == null || v !== v ? d : v;\n    });\n\n    /**\n     * Finds the set (i.e. no duplicates) of all elements in the first list not\n     * contained in the second list.

Sanctuary is a functional programming library inspired by Haskell and\n//. PureScript. It depends on and works nicely with [Ramda][]. Sanctuary\n//. makes it possible to write safe code without null checks.\n//.\n//. In JavaScript it's trivial to introduce a possible run-time type error:\n//.\n//.     words[0].toUpperCase()\n//.\n//. If `words` is `[]` we'll get a familiar error at run-time:\n//.\n//.     TypeError: Cannot read property 'toUpperCase' of undefined\n//.\n//. Sanctuary gives us a fighting chance of avoiding such errors. We might\n//. write:\n//.\n//.     R.map(S.toUpper, S.head(words))\n//.\n//. ## Types\n//.\n//. Sanctuary uses Haskell-like type signatures to describe the types of\n//. values, including functions. `'foo'`, for example, has type `String`;\n//. `[1, 2, 3]` has type `[Number]`. The arrow (`->`) is used to express a\n//. function's type. `Math.abs`, for example, has type `Number -> Number`.\n//. That is, it takes an argument of type `Number` and returns a value of\n//. type `Number`.\n//.\n//. [`R.map`][R.map] has type `(a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]`. That is, it takes\n//. an argument of type `a -> b` and returns a value of type `[a] -> [b]`.\n//. `a` and `b` are type variables: applying `R.map` to a value of type\n//. `String -> Number` will give a value of type `[String] -> [Number]`.\n//.\n//. Sanctuary embraces types. JavaScript doesn't support algebraic data types,\n//. but these can be simulated by providing a group of constructor functions\n//. whose prototypes provide the same set of methods. A value of the Maybe\n//. type, for example, is created via the Nothing constructor or the Just\n//. constructor.\n//.\n//. It's necessary to extend Haskell's notation to describe implicit arguments\n//. to the *methods* provided by Sanctuary's types. In `x.map(y)`, for example,\n//. the `map` method takes an implicit argument `x` in addition to the explicit\n//. argument `y`. The type of the value upon which a method is invoked appears\n//. at the beginning of the signature, separated from the arguments and return\n//. value by a squiggly arrow (`~>`). The type of the `map` method of the Maybe\n//. type is written `Maybe a ~> (a -> b) -> Maybe b`. One could read this as:\n//.\n//. _When the `map` method is invoked on a value of type `Maybe a`\n//. (for any type `a`) with an argument of type `a -> b` (for any type `b`),\n//. it returns a value of type `Maybe b`._\n//.\n//. Sanctuary supports type classes: constraints on type variables. Whereas\n//. `a -> a` implicitly supports every type, `Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a ->\n//. f b` requires that `f` be a type which satisfies the requirements of the\n//. Functor type class. Type-class constraints appear at the beginning of a\n//. type signature, separated from the rest of the signature by a fat arrow\n//. (`=>`).\n//.\n//. ### Accessible pseudotype\n//.\n//. What is the type of values which support property access? In other words,\n//. what is the type of which every value except `null` and `undefined` is a\n//. member? Object is close, but `Object.create(null)` produces a value which\n//. supports property access but which is not a member of the Object type.\n//.\n//. Sanctuary uses the Accessible pseudotype to represent the set of values\n//. which support property access.\n//.\n//. ### Integer pseudotype\n//.\n//. The Integer pseudotype represents integers in the range (-2^53 .. 2^53).\n//. It is a pseudotype because each Integer is represented by a Number value.\n//. Sanctuary's run-time type checking asserts that a valid Number value is\n//. provided wherever an Integer value is required.\n//.\n//. ### List pseudotype\n//.\n//. The List pseudotype represents non-Function values with numeric `length`\n//. properties greater than or equal to zero, such as `[1, 2, 3]` and `'foo'`.\n//.\n//. ### Type representatives\n//.\n//. What is the type of `Number`? One answer is `a -> Number`, since it's a\n//. function which takes an argument of any type and returns a Number value.\n//. When provided as the first argument to [`is`](#is), though, `Number` is\n//. really the value-level representative of the Number type.\n//.\n//. Sanctuary uses the TypeRep pseudotype to describe type representatives.\n//. For example:\n//.\n//.     Number :: TypeRep Number\n//.\n//. `Number` is the sole inhabitant of the TypeRep Number type.\n//.\n//. ## Type checking\n//.\n//. Sanctuary functions are defined via [sanctuary-def][] to provide run-time\n//. type checking. This is tremendously useful during development: type errors\n//. are reported immediately, avoiding circuitous stack traces (at best) and\n//. silent failures due to type coercion (at worst). For example:\n//.\n//. ```javascript\n//. S.inc('XXX');\n//. // ! TypeError: Invalid value\n//. //\n//. //   inc :: FiniteNumber -> FiniteNumber\n//. //          ^^^^^^^^^^^^\n//. //               1\n//. //\n//. //   1)  \"XXX\" :: String\n//. //\n//. //   The value at position 1 is not a member of ‘FiniteNumber’.\n//. ```\n//.\n//. Compare this to the behaviour of Ramda's unchecked equivalent:\n//.\n//. ```javascript\n//. R.inc('XXX');\n//. // => NaN\n//. ```\n//.\n//. There is a performance cost to run-time type checking. One may wish to\n//. disable type checking in certain contexts to avoid paying this cost.\n//. There are actually two versions of the Sanctuary module: one with type\n//. checking; one without. The latter is accessible via the `unchecked`\n//. property of the former.\n//.\n//. When application of `S.unchecked.<name>` honours the function's type\n//. signature the result will be the same as if `S.<name>` had been used\n//. instead. Otherwise, the behaviour is unspecified.\n//.\n//. In Node, one could use an environment variable to determine which version\n//. of the Sanctuary module to use:\n//.\n//. ```javascript\n//. const S = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ?\n//.             require('sanctuary').unchecked :\n//.             require('sanctuary');\n//. ```\n//.\n//. ## API\n\n/* global define, self */\n\n;(function(f) {\n\n  'use strict';\n\n  /* istanbul ignore else */\n  if (typeof module === 'object' && typeof module.exports === 'object') {\n    module.exports = f(require('ramda'), require('sanctuary-def'));\n  } else if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd != null) {\n    define(['ramda', 'sanctuary-def'], f);\n  } else {\n    self.sanctuary = f(self.R, self.sanctuaryDef);\n  }\n\n}(function(R, $) {\n\n  'use strict';\n\n  var _ = R.__;\n\n  var sentinel = {};\n\n  //  _type :: a -> String\n  var _type = function(x) {\n    return x != null && R.type(x['@@type']) === 'String' ? x['@@type']\n                                                         : R.type(x);\n  };\n\n  //  compose2 :: ((b -> c), (a -> b)) -> a -> c\n  var compose2 = function(f, g) {\n    return function(x) {\n      return f(g(x));\n    };\n  };\n\n  //  compose3 :: ((b -> c), (a -> b), a) -> c\n  var compose3 = function(f, g, x) {\n    return f(g(x));\n  };\n\n  //  filter :: (Monad m, Monoid m) => ((a -> Boolean), m a) -> m a\n  var filter = function(pred, m) {\n    return m.chain(function(x) {\n      return pred(x) ? m.of(x) : m.empty();\n    });\n  };\n\n  //  hasMethod :: String -> Any -> Boolean\n  var hasMethod = function(name) {\n    return function(x) {\n      return x != null && typeof x[name] === 'function';\n    };\n  };\n\n  //  inspect :: -> String\n  var inspect = /* istanbul ignore next */ function() {\n    return this.toString();\n  };\n\n  //  negativeZero :: a -> Boolean\n  var negativeZero = R.either(R.equals(-0),\n                              R.equals(new Number(-0)));  // jshint ignore:line\n\n  //  Accessible :: TypeClass\n  var Accessible = $.TypeClass(\n    'sanctuary/Accessible',\n    function(x) { return x != null; }\n  );\n\n  //  Apply :: TypeClass\n  var Apply = $.TypeClass(\n    'sanctuary/Apply',\n    function(x) {\n      return R.contains(_type(x), ['Array', 'Function']) ||\n             Functor.test(x) && hasMethod('ap')(x);\n    }\n  );\n\n  //  Foldable :: TypeClass\n  var Foldable = $.TypeClass(\n    'sanctuary/Foldable',\n    function(x) {\n      return _type(x) === 'Array' || hasMethod('reduce');\n    }\n  );\n\n  //  Functor :: TypeClass\n  var Functor = $.TypeClass(\n    'sanctuary/Functor',\n    function(x) {\n      return R.contains(_type(x), ['Array', 'Function']) ||\n             hasMethod('map')(x);\n    }\n  );\n\n  //  Monoid :: TypeClass\n  var Monoid = $.TypeClass(\n    'sanctuary/Monoid',\n    function(x) {\n      return R.contains(_type(x), ['Array', 'Boolean', 'Object', 'String']) ||\n             hasMethod('empty')(x);\n    }\n  );\n\n  //  Ord :: TypeClass\n  var Ord = $.TypeClass(\n    'sanctuary/Ord',\n    R.anyPass([$.String.test, $.ValidDate.test, $.ValidNumber.test])\n  );\n\n  //  Semigroup :: TypeClass\n  var Semigroup = $.TypeClass(\n    'sanctuary/Semigroup',\n    hasMethod('concat')\n  );\n\n  var a = $.TypeVariable('a');\n  var b = $.TypeVariable('b');\n  var c = $.TypeVariable('c');\n  var d = $.TypeVariable('d');\n  var l = $.TypeVariable('l');\n  var r = $.TypeVariable('r');\n\n  //  $Either :: Type -> Type -> Type\n  var $Either = $.BinaryType(\n    'sanctuary/Either',\n    function(x) { return x != null && x['@@type'] === 'sanctuary/Either'; },\n    function(either) { return either.isLeft ?
